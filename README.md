## 🌟 Vision

AuditPilot aims to become an open-source compliance operating system for:

- Security compliance
- Risk management
- Evidence management
- Audit readiness
- Remediation tracking
- AI governance
- Continuous compliance

The long-term workflow is:

```text
Gap detected
      ↓
Explain why it matters
      ↓
Map to framework controls
      ↓
Generate CAPA
      ↓
Create remediation ticket
      ↓
Recommend required evidence
      ↓
Track until closure
```

Most compliance tools stop at identifying a gap.

AuditPilot aims to support the full remediation lifecycle.
